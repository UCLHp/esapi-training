# esapi-training
NON-CLINICAL scripts. Purely for practice with ESAPI and C#.  


## Overview
This repo hopefully contains useful information for you to get up and running with the Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI), C# and Visual Studios.
It also contains some sample scripts to show the range of functionality we might be able to benefit from. As of Eclipse v16.1 we have access to 
write-enabled scripting for proton planning. Script-specific information and learning points can be found in the projects themselves.


## Visual Studio
You don't technically need to use this IDE, but everyone else does and it seems very nice. You can get the free Community edition [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/).
I've been using Visual Studio Community 2019 for this work. During installation you will be asked what "Workloads" you want - make sure to tick ".NET desktop development" and
"Universal Windows Platform development". If you find that don't have these, just open Visual Studio and go to Tools > Get Tools and Features... > Workloads to install them.
